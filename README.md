# Multi Temp Sensor Bake Off
A bit of a tangent project as I was testing out different temperature sensors. The general idea
is that using an ESP32 attached to a small OLED display there are multiple temperature sensors
attached to the ESP32. The measurements of each device are displayed on the OLED so you can
see how they compare without needing to monitor a serial connection.

This also represents my first project since switching from Arduino IDE to Platform IO.
